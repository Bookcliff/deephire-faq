There is a bug in iOS version 14.2 that may cause iOS users to hear studdered audio.

The issue has been patched by apple in iOS versions 14.3 and above.

It is suggested to update your iOS device to the latest version if you are going to be conducting interviews with your phone.

This issue may happen occasionally for job seekers over the next few weeks. 18% of iOS users are currently on the iOS version with the bug (14.2). This number will likely drop down to <10% as people update their iPhones/iPads.

For client interviews - it may be useful to ask job seekers which device they will be using for the interview and if it is an iPhone, asking them to update their iOS version before the interview.

The current fixes are:
A. Update iOS version
B. Use a different device
C. Use the computer version of DeepHire
