"Once you enter your interview, you'll first be taken to a Practice Interview.

![Your hardware will be tested automatically!](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/96ec5e572d82d800/image_1ip9ymh.png)

First, you'll have to allow DeepHire access to your webcam/microphone.

Once completed, the test will run automatically.

Three tests are run: Camera, Network, and Audio.

The Camera test makes sure that your webcam/camera is properly connected and receives video input.

The Network test checks your connection, to make sure you have a strong enough internet connect to upload your videos.

The Audio test makes sure that your microphone is working properly, so you can be heard loud and clear!

## What do I do if a test fails?

Don't worry! If a test fails, we will immediately reach out to you through the chat with next steps.

Our tech support team is online 24/7 to make sure you are able to complete your video interview.
